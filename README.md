Grayscale Image Basics

Properties
• Grayscale images consist of pixels in the form of (0-255) that display a shade of gray.
All pixels have a value of 0 to 255:
0 represents black.
255 represents white.

Anywhere from 0 to 255, remember that this is the grayscale scale.

Pixel Value Calculation

The key thing to know here is – when an image goes through grayscale conversion, the color information about any pixel (which is red, green) and blue will be added up together.

It is calculated using an expression that usually takes into account green more as the eye of humans is more responsive to the light rays of wavelengths around 518nm which lies in the range of green light.

Example Code Explanation

For example using OpenCV, we can load a grayscale image and find the min/categories: Image Processing HOME /Category:Image Processing Here's a quick course to understand how you can work with images in Python by practicing some examples!
